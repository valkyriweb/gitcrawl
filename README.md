`gitcrawl` is a local-first GitHub issue and pull request crawler for maintainer triage. Data stays local in SQLite. The primary runtime surfaces are the CLI, JSON command output, and the terminal UI. There is no local HTTP API.

Full documentation: [gitcrawl.sh](https://gitcrawl.sh)

## Status

Early bootstrap. The implementation is being built in small commits.

`gitcrawl clusters` and `gitcrawl tui` match ghcrawl's display view: latest raw run clusters first, closed durable rows merged as historical context, sorted by size by default. Pass `--hide-closed` to focus only currently open clusters. `gitcrawl durable-clusters` stays on governed durable rows and needs `--include-closed` for inactive rows.
`gitcrawl cluster` and `gitcrawl refresh` build ghcrawl-shaped durable clusters by default (`--threshold 0.80`, `--min-size 1`, `--max-cluster-size 40`, `--k 16`, `--cross-kind-threshold 0.93`): every active vector-backed thread is represented, singleton rows use `singleton_orphan`, multi-member rows use `duplicate_candidate`, and stable IDs are derived from the representative thread. They also add deterministic GitHub reference evidence for direct issue/PR links such as `#123`, `issues/123`, and `pull/123`. Weak embedding edges need concrete title-token overlap unless their similarity is already high, which keeps generic low-confidence bridges from forming unrelated clusters.
`gitcrawl tui` infers the most recently updated local repository when `owner/repo` is omitted. `serve` is intentionally not part of `gitcrawl`.
`gitcrawl sync` fetches open issues and pull requests by default. Pass `--state all` or `--state closed` for explicit backfill workflows; incremental open syncs with `--since` also sweep recently closed items so local open state does not rot.
Pass `--numbers` to refresh exact issue or pull request rows without relying on list ordering or updated-time windows.
Pass `--with pr-details` or `--include-pr-details` to hydrate pull request files, commits, checks, and workflow runs for local review. The `gh` shim can also auto-hydrate one exact PR on a PR-detail miss, then retry locally.
`gitcrawl search issues|prs` accepts the common `gh search` shape (`<query> -R owner/repo --state open --json fields --limit N`) and answers from the local SQLite cache. It is intended for discovery without spending GitHub REST search quota; use `gh` for final live verification and GitHub write actions. Pass `--sync-if-stale 5m` to perform one metadata sync before the cached search when the local repository mirror is older than that duration.
`gitcrawl gh` is a gh-compatible shim for agent workflows. It answers broad `gh search issues|prs`, `gh issue/pr list`, supported `gh issue/pr view --json` fields, hydrated `gh pr checks`, and hydrated `gh run list/view` from local SQLite, then falls through to the real GitHub CLI for unsupported commands. Local `gh issue/pr list` supports common filters such as `--author`, `--assignee`, and repeated `--label`. Read-only fallthroughs such as `gh pr diff`, `gh repo view/list`, `gh release list/view`, `gh workflow list/view`, `gh secret list`, `gh variable get/list`, `gh label list`, read-only `gh search` kinds, GET-only REST `gh api` calls, and read-only `gh api graphql` queries use a command-aware persistent cache under `cache/gh-shim`; Actions run/job logs get longer TTLs, completed run/job reads are kept much longer than active CI status, user profile reads get a 7-day TTL, read-only GraphQL gets a 6-hour TTL, and `gh pr diff` entries are keyed by the cached PR head SHA when available. Explicit API paths and explicit repositories share cache entries across sibling checkouts even when agents set different `GH_REPO` values; implicit repo reads stay isolated by `GH_REPO` or current working directory. Cache keys canonicalize common flags such as `-R`/`--repo` and sorted `--json` fields so equivalent agent commands coalesce. Repeat read failures are cached by default so agents do not rediscover the same missing release or workflow, but rate-limit error entries expire quickly; if GitHub rate-limits a refresh and an expired successful entry exists, the shim serves the stale response with a warning instead of failing the read. When another process is refreshing an expired successful entry, peers may serve stale inside a short grace window instead of joining the backend stampede. Set `GITCRAWL_GH_STALE_GRACE=0` to disable stale-while-revalidate, or `GITCRAWL_GH_CACHE_ERRORS=0` to disable error caching. Mutating commands pass through, increment write counters, and invalidate matching cache tags instead of flushing unrelated entries. `gh xcache stats|keys|gc|flush|reset|snapshot` inspects, garbage-collects, clears, resets, or snapshots fallthrough-cache counters, including hit rate plus per-command, per-route, per-key, and `--since` recent-window miss counters. Set `GITCRAWL_GH_PATH` to choose the backend `gh`, and symlink or install the binary as `gh`/`gitcrawl-gh` to run the shim directly.
The TUI starts at `--min-size 5` and `--sort size`, like ghcrawl's saved default, so the first screen is the useful cluster workload instead of singleton noise. Pass `--min-size 1` when you intentionally want singleton clusters. Mouse support is built in: click rows, wheel panes, and right-click for copy, sort, filter, jump, link, neighbor, local close/reopen, and member triage actions. Press `a` to open the same action menu from the keyboard, `#` to jump directly to an issue or PR number, `p` to switch between repositories already present in the local store, or `n` to load neighbors for the selected issue or PR. Enter from the members pane also loads neighbors before opening detail. The TUI quietly refreshes from the local store every 15 seconds.
