# Refresh and embed
{: .no_toc }

`gitcrawl refresh` is the one command most users want. It runs sync → embed → cluster in order, with the same flags you would use individually.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## refresh

```bash
gitcrawl refresh owner/repo
```

By default this performs:

1. **Sync** — open + recently closed issues and PRs (see [Sync](/sync/))
2. **Embed** — fill `thread_vectors` for any thread whose document changed
3. **Cluster** — rebuild durable clusters with the standard thresholds

Disable any stage with `--no-sync`, `--no-embed`, `--no-cluster`. The remaining stages still run; failures are reported per stage in the JSON output.

### Stage-specific flags

`refresh` forwards flags through to the underlying stages:

| Forwarded to | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| sync | `--since`, `--state`, `--limit`, `--include-comments` |
| embed | `--limit` |
| cluster | `--threshold` (0.80), `--min-size` (1), `--max-cluster-size` (40), `--k` (16), `--cross-kind-threshold` (0.93) |

`--include-code` is accepted but currently a no-op.

### JSON output

```bash
gitcrawl refresh owner/repo --json
```

```json
{
  "repository": "owner/repo",
  "sync": { "selected": 124, "inserted": 12, "updated": 9, "run_id": 42 },
  "embed": { "selected": 21, "embedded": 21, "skipped": 0, "failed": 0, "model": "text-embedding-3-small", "run_id": 43 },
  "cluster": {
    "threshold": 0.8, "cross_kind": 0.93, "min_size": 1, "max_size": 40, "k": 16,
    "vector_count": 312, "edge_count": 1042, "cluster_count": 87, "member_count": 312, "run_id": 44
  }
}
```

Each stage object mirrors the JSON shape of the standalone command. You can read the per-stage `run_id` later via `gitcrawl runs --kind sync|embedding|cluster`.

## embed

```bash
gitcrawl embed owner/repo
```

Generates OpenAI embeddings for any thread whose document hash has changed since its last embedding. Works through the database in batches (default size 64) with bounded concurrency (default 2).

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--number <n>` | _(any)_ | Embed a single issue/PR by number |
| `--limit <n>` | _(no limit)_ | Maximum rows to embed in this run |
| `--force` | _(off)_ | Re-embed every selected row, ignoring content hash |
| `--include-closed` | _(off)_ | Include closed threads |

### When to `--force`

You should rarely need it. The pipeline auto-forces a rebuild when:

- The configured embedding model changes (`GITCRAWL_EMBED_MODEL` or `embed_model` in config)
- The embedding input rune cap changes (so older, larger-cap vectors are not silently mixed in)

Use `--force` manually if you have manually edited vectors, or want to confirm an output is reproducible from scratch.

### Failure handling

OpenAI errors are retried with backoff unless `GITCRAWL_OPENAI_RETRY_DISABLED=1`. The JSON output includes a `failures` array with batch-level diagnostics (`batch_start`, `batch_end`, `attempts`, `status`, `code`, `message`) so partial failures do not silently drop rows.

Oversized inputs are capped before being sent upstream so a single huge body cannot exceed the model's input limit.

### JSON output

```json
{
  "repository": "owner/repo",
  "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
  "basis": "title_original",
  "selected": 21,
  "embedded": 20,
  "skipped": 0,
  "failed": 1,
  "retries": 3,
  "status": "ok",
  "failures": [
    { "batch_start": 16, "batch_end": 17, "attempts": 3, "status": 429, "type": "rate_limit", "code": "rate_limit_exceeded", "message": "..." }
  ],
  "run_id": 43
}
```

## runs

Inspect what `refresh`, `sync`, `embed`, or `cluster` actually did:

```bash
gitcrawl runs owner/repo --kind sync       # default kind
gitcrawl runs owner/repo --kind embedding
gitcrawl runs owner/repo --kind cluster
```

Each row carries `started_at`, `finished_at`, `status`, and `stats_json` — useful when an agent needs to know whether a sync is fresh enough or whether the last cluster pass converged.

## Cost notes

- **GitHub.** Sync uses standard REST endpoints; the API quota is the dominant cost on busy repos. Use `--include-comments` and `--with pr-details` selectively.
- **OpenAI.** `text-embedding-3-small` is inexpensive but not free. `embed` is bounded by `--limit` if you want to stay under a budget on initial backfills.
- **Disk.** Vectors, generated documents, and raw API payloads grow with the repo. The portable-store flow includes `gitcrawl portable prune` to keep published payloads small while retaining compact comments and PR details — see [Portable stores](/portable-stores/).
